The Energy Finance Tracker database is a project of Oil Change International’s Public Finance Program, which is working to end public finance for fossil fuels and shift it to support a just energy transition. You can read our latest program updates and press releases [on our website](https://priceofoil.org/). Below you can find direct links to key public finance research from Oil Change International and our partners.

### Research Spotlight

[At A Crossroads](http://priceofoil.org/g20-at-a-crossroads) (September 2022) is the most recent analysis of our G20 international public finance dataset from Oil Change International and Friends of the Earth US. This report provides an update to previous reports [Past Last Call](https://priceofoil.org/2021/10/28/past-last-call-g20-public-finance-institutions-are-still-bankrolling-fossil-fuels/) (2021), [Still Digging](http://priceofoil.org/2020/05/27/g20-still-digging/) (2020) and [Talk is Cheap](http://priceofoil.org/2017/07/05/g20-financing-climate-disaster/) (2017) detailing earlier trends.

### Recommendations for international public finance institutions

Governments' public finance choices play a large role in shaping our future energy system. Here are some key research papers on how they should use their public finance institutions to support a globally just transition away from fossil fuels.

- [Using international public finance to unlock a just transition: key trends and opportunities](https://priceofoil.org/2022/04/20/finance-database-briefing/) (2022)

### Energy Access

The UN Sustainable Development Goals call for universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services by 2030, but a lack of finance means we are not on track to reach this target. The following reports look deeper into the Public Finance for Energy Database to show very little G20 public finance is flowing to energy access of any kind, and that the distributed renewable energy that is most needed to close the gap is particularly under funded. 

- [How multilateral development banks can boost small-scale energy solutions](https://www.e3g.org/publications/how-multilateral-development-banks-mdbs-can-boost-small-scale-energy-solutions/) (2022)

- [Assessing International Public Finance for Energy in Africa: Where Do Development and Climate Priorities Stand?](http://priceofoil.org/2018/07/23/assessing-international-public-finance-for-energy-in-africa/) (2018)

### Export Credit Agencies

ECAs are consistently the worst public finance actors for the climate, providing 11 times more support for fossil fuels than renewable energy in 2018-2020. The following papers examine the opportunities and obstacles for ECAs to shift their finance.   

- [Export finance for the past or the future? Why E3F member countries must end oil and gas financing and finance a climate-compatible future](http://priceofoil.org/2021/11/22/new-research-e3f-countries-need-to-shift-their-eur-19-billion-in-export-finance-for-fossil-fuels-to-renewables/) (2021)

- [Legal opinion: Export credit agencies and states potentially at risk of climate litigation over finance for fossil fuels](http://priceofoil.org/2021/05/04/press-release-eca-legal-opinion/) (2021)

### Development Finance

With mandates for sustainable development and more granting components to their finance, remaining fossil fuel finance from bilateral DFIs and the multilateral development banks is particularly harmful. Read more below on trends in the MDBs and on why public finance for gas is blocking rather than supporting just development.

### Public finance & fossil fuel subsidies

To get a holistic picture of support for fossil fuels from any one G20 government, Public Finance for Energy Database figures should be combined with data on direct domestic fossil fuel subsidies, domestic public finance, and support to energy-related state-owned enterprises. OCI and our peers have done so in the publications below.

- [Doubling Back and Doubling Down: G20 Scorecard on Fossil Fuel Funding](http://priceofoil.org/2020/11/09/g20-scorecard-2020/) (2020)
